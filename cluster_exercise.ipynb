    "Testing the Evolution of Starclusters with Amuse and making predictions for Gaia \n",
    "================================================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will be guided to use AMUSE to conduct a numerical n-body experiment and make predictions for Gaia. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bigger question you will address concerns the question of how stars form. We know that stars typically (and possibly always) form in clusters. However, the birth conditions are very hard to measure.  For example: How \"clumpy\" or \"smooth\" are these clusters? How \"virialized\" are they?  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will simulate the evolution of star clusters, with different initial conditions. The aim is to investigate if the initial conditions leave imprints that Gaia can observe.  Specifically you will investigate the population of \"escapers\" and possible \"runaway stars\", i.e. stars that escape their birth cluster.  To do this we will very closely follow the work by Allison (2012, MNRAS 421, 3338). \n",
    "\n",
    "You will report the results of your numerical experiments in the style of a \"letter\" (= short paper normally on a very timely topic.) Detailed instructions below. The questions in this tutorial are to guide you through the experiment. You can use them for the narrative of your report, but the report should be in the style of a self containing paper, not a numbered list to the questions here.  "
